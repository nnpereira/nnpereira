## Hi there, I'm Niha 👋

- 🔭 Freelancing as a data consultant while I look for my next full time role. I've spent the majority of my career working with orgs in the social sector.
- 🌱 Currently learning about Responsible AI and how we can reduce fairness related harms.
- ☕️ Fun fact: I will always opt for a piping hot cup of masala chai over coffee.
